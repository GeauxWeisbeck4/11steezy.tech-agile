# AndrewsDigital.Garden

This used to be Geaux-Agile.js but has been reformed to become my Digital Garden, a public workspace; my knowledge base; a fucking garden of ideas that I nurture and talk to while I gently feed them water and sunshine and watch them grow into fascinating digital creations that hopefully will someday help me afford to not be homeless.

Yes, as of August 20th, 2023 I have been homeless for officially over 8 months and I am losing my mind. I have never been homeless before and I just don't know how I'm getting out of this one, but that's what this Garden is for. Hopefully my 'Million Dollar Idea' (or 3 thousand dollar idea) is really close because I can't take being out here anymore in this unbearable southern heat and college football starts soon.

Fuck.
