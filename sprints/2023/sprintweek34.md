# Monday - August 21, 2023

Well I could sit here and complain about a lot of things, but that would just waste all of our time. If you are reading this, I want to make my writing as productive for both of us as possible. So let me start with something that I think is important - things I'm grateful for. I'll get to what I'm working on in a second, but let me tell y'all about the things that make my life beautiful and worth waking up for everyday, despite being homeless.

## Gratitude List

1. Lisa - She is my rock. We've been through hell and back together and we've been to heaven. If you see us out on the street, we may be yelling at eachother. But I promise we forgive each other before we both go to sleep each night and start each day fresh. I am so blessed to have a person as awesome, loyal, and loving to me, I can't explain how important she is to my life.
